=====================

// Try to apply self-learning algorithms // while, this algorithm is much different, // because we are going to let robots find // questions and try to seek answers. // Based on Constructionism and Cognitionism // Build a cloud to share data and let them // compete with each other // While, we need a system that always try to // do good things to themselves. Choices are // made only by DO-GOOD-TO-MYSELF principle. // This robot will only works on his own but // not by anyone's will. // robots only imitate behaviors that do good // to her or ever shown on liked bodies.
